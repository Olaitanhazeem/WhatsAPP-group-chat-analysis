Also, important group discussion and engagement will be fixed at the most convenient time of the group members based on past data.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The raw data from the WhatsApp group chat was stored as a text file which was loaded into power query editor.

The data was transformed by splitting the column by delimiter to have a separate columns for date, time and student. The message in the group was removed out because it is irrelevant for this analysis.

Each column type were changed eg data column to date type, time column to time type and student column to text type.
Duplicate and blank columns or rows were removed and a clean data set was achieved.

The month with the highest number of engagement is OCTOBER 2021Â , because during the month the university started her first semester examination thus drive student to engage in the group. Similar reason too for the increase in engagement in month like FEBRUARY. JULY engagement was driven by the students been new to the school environment.

The most active time in the group is 7:31 PM ,however not rigid. It is not logical to say meaningful conversation will be held, rather from a logical perspective, it is safe to say that the most active time in the group is the EVENING from 7:30pm till 10:30pm.
# RECOMMENDATION

A thorough look at the analysis and from the problem statement, discussions or engagement should be fixed during the evening period for the convenient of the admin and the group members.

Based on number of engagement in the group, those the higher engagement should be entrusted with dissemination of information as they drive more engagement.
# LIMITATION

This report could not filter out the members who are no more in the group but had been engaged.

This report fails to give clear distinction between noise and engagement. perhaps those in the list of most active members are actually noisemakers.
