*Therefore, we're inviting you to the Fellowship of Management Christian Students' Freshers' Orientation.*

8/7/21, 09:04 - +234 810 074 9690: Hi everyone, my name is Akeem Gbadegesin ( Wise ✌🏽) a former President of faculty of management sciences.

First of all, congratulations to everyone that made the graduation list and for those that couldn't find their names, please it's not the end of the world... We all lose some battles in life and what's important is how we react to it. So please keep your heads up and try harder, this is just a phase and it will surely pass.

Another key thing I found is level of exposure matters a lot in the outside world which I think our school lacks compared to the likes of Unilag and OAU... 

What we are good at is 'BOOKS' and discovering where lecturer pick their questions from (my set were masters in this 😂 😂)

Don't get me wrong, 'books' play a huge role too but just that it's not enough...

When it comes to exposure, the likes of Covenant, Unilag, OAU and Babcock are way ahead of us..... You see the 3 months holiday break we get that most of us usually just stay at home, most students from the schools I listed above use theirs to get internships with top companies and gain experience under their belt... While we sit at home to be eating and sleeping(I am also a culprit).... 

Some of you may argue that it's because Unilag is Lagos but most of us also reside in Lagos.. Plus the internship doesn't necessarily have to be BIG 4 or the likes, there are small coys that can even offer more than big coys especially Audit Firms

Asides that I think our school system didn't help matters too... 

There are certain soft skills we were supposed to have been taught but the school didn't ( Accounting software, MS tools) 

 This is one of the benefits people from some schools listed above get which in turn gives them upper hand when they get to the labour market

Also, their alumni play huge role in their exposure by helping them invite top people in the industry for the events the faculty/department organizes.... 

I commend the efforts TAX CLUB and INVESTMENT SOCIETY for being able to invite the like of TAIWO AYODELE (PwC) and ABAYOMI (Andersen) for their events.... Those are the caliber of people that should be gracing department / faculty events... I'll advice the current administration(faculty n department) to partner with these clubs and make the event even more bigger.

But theres no point crying over spilled milk and we can't really blame them considering the way things are done in the country generally and most of us(alumni) are still trying to find our feet.
To cut the long story short... In order to increase your chances of getting your preferred job, there are key things you need to equip yourself with. 
1. Good CV
2. Soft skills (Microsoft office tools) 
3. Additional qualifications 
4. Networking (Linkedin) 
5. Prayer

So as a form of giving back / volunteering, I want to take you on the following for FREE... 

* How to write a good CV
* Linkedin optimization 
* How to write cold mails

This would be done via a zoom session probably next week, I'll get back with the details soon.

   *_FAMSSA CINEMA COMPLAINT_*

_Hello famssite_

The welfarism of our students is our utmost priority. It saddens our hearts, the complaints received from students that they were denied entrance into the cinema to see a movie which they paid for.


On this note, we hereby call on the victims of this incidence, who were unable to get value for their money with the condition (that is, presence at the venue within the hours of 12pm - 6pm) in place being met to kindly get in touch with the PRO of the faculty with prove or evidence, in order to get a resolve.

A maximum of 24hours has been designated to get in touch with everyone affected in order to collate the total number of students and get a quick resolve.

 Thank you.

- Total number of votes cast Big Brother Nigeria 2018 = 170m

- Total number of votes cast General election 2019 = 27m

A practical reality of who we are as people and where our priority lies as citizens. 

The Funny side in all of these; we still go to bed, have a good sleep and wake up with the hope to meet a Nigeria we didn't create.
BBN 2020 ON MY MIND:

Total number of votes cast during Britain Got talent 2017 = 6.2million votes

Total number of votes cast during American got talent 2017 = 52.1million votes. American population is twice Nigerian population.

Mind you, most of the votes cast on either Britain or American got talent are absolutely free because you can vote on their websites & on the Apps without paying a dime.

Total number of votes cast during “Big Brother Nigeria” 2018 = 170million votes @ N30 per sms for a show that contributes absolutely nothing to their lives. Going by the figures, it will take America & Britain combined three & half years to organise a talent show to catch up with Nigeria.

It is neither a talent show or life enhancing or promoting show. A show where two adults are kept in a cage to freely give & take sex on National Television, while the organisers make more money from the youths.

If INEC organises general election this weekend and ask Nigerian youths to vote on their mobile phones @ N10 per SMS to elect leaders that will shape their futures & the country, they will ask Nigerian Government to credit their accounts 1st before they will agree to vote in that magnitude.

“Wasted Generation” ~ Prof. Wole Soyinka called them.

“A generation that play too much, sleep too much and engage in idle chatter and gossip" ~ Chief Obafemi Awolowo foresaw

“A generation of illiterate graduates” ~ Atiku Abubakar called them in 2016

A generation that  never plan for tomorrow.... Hopeless generation. Oladosu Oluwafemi called them 2020

A generation that are constantly not concerned about the deteriorating conditions of their senses & not bothered about their own future~ Osquare78 knows them.

“Idle youths who sit and do nothing, but expecting everything from govt free” ~Pre. Buhari surmised about them

We all must be wary of this generation.... they are the larger chunk of Nigerian population.

It is pathetic. 170 Million votes Multiplied by N30 = N 5.1 billion and the winner got N25 million plus an SUV worth N12 million a trip and electronics. Let us even assume that sms votes is 85 million, that will be N2.55 billion. So so sad... COPIED

Why C no go dey before.
What I'm trying to tell you is that you are maximizing profit so it's x+y</=0
So you need the inner part not the upper part
8/15/21, 08:48 - Felix Bus Admn: Maybe you should try and shade the point you need either upper o lower and then show me your point A,B,c
8/15/21, 08:51 - +234 909 136 9146: Wa alaikum sallam....

8/15/21, 09:07 - Felix Bus Admn: I don't say the C is not there but it's in the inner part of the graph not the upper

 "COMING GENERATION SCARES ME...REAL HARD!"

While we have been busy talking about Nigeria of today, I wonder if we have spared a thought about how this country will be in the next TWENTY-FIVE years. 

On October 1, 1979, when Alhaji Shehu Usman Aliyu Shagari was sworn-in as president, Goodluck Jonathan was just a 22 year-old undergrad of University of Port-Harcourt. Shagari was 54 years old. Ayo Fayose was 19 years old. Bukola Saraki was 17. Yemi Osibajo was 22. The generation of the likes of Shagari, Richard Akinjide, Adisa Akinloye, Sabo Barkin Zuwo, Sam Mbakwe, Jim Ifeanyichukwu Nwobodo, Ume Ezeoke,  Christian Onoh, Akin Omoboriowo, Olusola Saraki, Sunday Awoniyi, Garba Nadama, Awal Ibrahim and so on has gone for good!

 Some of us in our 40s, 50s and 60s now, where  in school then, either in the university or secondary school. We had lofty dreams, both personal and societal. We were always motivated by nationalists and inventors who had impacted positively on the cause of humanity.  We were voracious readers of novels and other books. Nelkon for our Ordinary Level Physics, Lambert for Chemistry, B.O ADELEKE and Goh Cheng Leong for our Geography, Phebean Ogundipe for Practical English, William Shakespeare Chinua Achebe, Cyprian Ekwensi, OLa Rotimi and Wole Soyinka for Literature and others like that. 

We were always flaunting our knowledge of current affairs. Inter-school quiz, Literary and Debating competition were the in-thing. Nowadays, students can hardly string a sentence together in English without errors.

Fast forward 35 years on and you are shocked and disturbed. Have you ever spoken to or engaged a 20 year-old boy? Ask him what motivates him and he is likely to mention music, hip hop to be precise. He has hundreds of downloaded songs on his phone. He can sing all of them off hand. He knows all the singles of Nice, Neato C, Timaya, Davido, Whiz Kid off hand. The babes among them take pride in enticing men old enough to be their father on social media with buxomly physique. But he/she does not know anything about history of nationalism in the country. Ideas about good society, responsible family and good conduct do not motivate him. He just wants to make money because his friend who does yahoo is rich and rides a good car, her friend who has numerous ‘aristos’ drives an SUV! 

The things that interest him/her are things that do not add value. He /she has google but never uses it for advancement of knowledge but to download porn and other inanities. Yet, in TWENTY years time, they are the ones that will be contesting to become governors, senators, Reps members and even president. 

They belong to a generation that does not care about morality. They belong to a generation that is motivated only by money and its acquisition. By 2035 to 2040, they will be our senators, Reps, governors and so on. 

I wonder if we have ever spared a thought for how this country will look like under them. I told a man recently and these are my words: IF A GUY WHO IS IN LAGOS COULD USE FALSE PRETENCE TO
OBTAIN $20,000 FROM SOMEONE IN UNITED STATES, WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN IF SUCH A GUY BECOMES A STATE GOVERNOR AND IS IN CHARGE OF AN ALLOCATION HE DOES NOT EVEN HAVE TO OBTAIN UNDER FALSE PRETENCE? WHICH HIS STATE IS STATUTORILY ENTITLED TO. How did we get into this mess? How can we get out of this predicament? I am worried, deeply worried. Are you?

How are we all doing and I hope the class rep duties ain’t choking us too much.
I am Fagbiye Oluwadamilola Elizabeth (Dammie) 
Vice President of Faculty of Management Sciences.

I would like to go straight to the reason I added everyone of you to this group.
There is “A Freshers Oratory Contest” organized by the The Union Of Campus Journalists in conjunction with the Student Union to hold next week. We are expected to produce a Representative who has to be a Fresher. Therefore we need a representative from each department in order to be fair with selection. The Faculty debate committee will meet with these representatives and screen who will represent the faculty.
I urge us all to select the best we know of from our individual levels. I chose to get in touch with you class reps because I believe by now you will know whose oratory skills are best among students.

All nominations should be dropped latest 5pm today.
Also we want Representatives that are readily available.
Thank you.

8/21/21, 11:13 - Kabirat Bus Admn: Take time to read.... very nice story..

A man woke up early in order to have his morning prayer (Subh). He got dressed, set on his way to Allah's house.

On his way to the MASJID, the man fell and his clothes got dirty.. He got up, brushed himself up, and headed home.

At home, he changed his clothes, and was, again, on his way to the MASJID.

On his way to the MASJID, he fell again at the same spot! He, again, got up, brushed himself off and headed home. 

At home he, once again, changed his clothes and was on his way to Allah's house.

On his way to the MASJID, he met a man holding a lamp. He asked the man of his identity and the man replied 'I saw you fall twice on your way to the MASJID, so I brought a lamp so I can light your way.

The first man thanked him profusely and the two went on their way to the MASJID.

Once at the MASJID, the first man asked the man with the lamp to come in and offer SALAAH with him.

The second man refused.

The first man asked him a couple more times and, again, the answer was the same.

The first man asked him why he did not wish to come in and pray.

The man replied, 'I am Satan'. The man was shocked at this reply. Satan went on to explain, 'I saw you on your way to the MASJID and it was I who made you fall. When you went home, cleaned yourself and went back on your way to the MASJID, Allah ( s.w.t) forgave all of your sins.

I made you fall a second time, and even that did not encourage you to stay home, but rather, you went back on your way to MASJID. Because of that, Allah (s.w.t) forgave all the sins of the people of your household.

I was afraid if I made you fall one more time, then Allah (s.w.t )will forgive the sins of the whole nation (world)so I made sure that you reached the MASJID safely.'

Do not put off the good you intended to do as you never know how much reward you might receive from the hardships you encounter while trying to achieve that good.

For your righteousness can save your family and nation at large.

Do this and see the victory of the Allah ( s.w.t )

If forwarding this message will bother you, or take too much time from you, then don't do it, but you will not get the reward of it, which is great.

Wouldn't it be easy just to press 'Forward' and receive this reward?

Praise be to Allah ( s.w.t) in the highest.

9/19/21, 06:18 - +234 812 485 8496: *HOW TO CALCULATE CGPA (UNILORIN)*

*Important Key points:*
📍 *GPA* means Grade Point Average and it can be got at the end of each semester.
📍 *CGPA* means Cumulative Grade Point Average; it's up-to-date mean of *GPA* and it can be got at the end of atleast 2 Semesters.

📍The grades are as follow:
A, B, C, D, E and F. 

✍️ Each grade is equivalent to a certain number of point. 
📍A - 5.
📍 B - 4.
📍C - 3.
📍D - 2.
📍 E - 1.
📍 F - 0.

The score for each grade:
📌 A: 70-100
📌 B: 60-69
📌 C: 50-59
📌 D: 45-49
📌 E: 40-44
📌 F: 0-39

Example: The following are the courses taken by *TRIPLEHAY* in his 100 Level first semester with Credit Units and the grades got after exams included:

*FIRST SEMESTER:*
      *COURSE*  *UNIT*  *GRADE*
📍GEM 101      3         A
📍CVE 103      2         B
📍ENG 107      2         B
📍MAC 101      3         C
📍HIS 103       2         D
📍EDU 107      2         E
📍PLB 103       1         F
📍GNS 111        2        B
📍ECN 103      3        C
*TOTAL UNIT (TU):* 20

https://wa.me/2349038634254?text=I+want+to+be+viewing+your+status,+my+name+is

*GRADE POINT PER COURSE:* is got by multiplying equivalent points of each grade got per course by its Credit Units.

Thus,
- GEM 101 (3×5) = 15
- CVE 103 (2×4) = 8
- ENG 107 (2×4) = 8
- MAC 101 (3×3) = 9
- HIS 103 (2×2) = 4
- EDU 107 (2×1) = 2
- PLB 103 (1×0) = 0
- GNS 111 (2×4) = 8
- ECN 103 (3×3) = 9

*TOTAL GRADE POINT (TGP):* 63

 *GPA* : TGP/TU
 *GPA* : 63/20
 *GPA* : 3.15

Total *GPA* of *TRIPLEHAY* at the end of 1st semester is *3.15* and let's assume *3.72* is for his 2nd semester.

To get his *CGPA* at the end of 100 Level having completed two semesters, you're to add the *GPA* for both semesters together and divide by two. 

Therefore, 3.15+3.72 = 6.87
*CGPA = 6.87/2 = 3.435*

*CLASS OF DEGREE & EQUIVALENT CGPA:*
- First Class (4.50-5.00)
- Second Class Upper (3.50-4.49)
- Second Class Lower (2.40-3.49)
- Third Class (1.50-2.39)
- Pass (1.0-1.49)

As at the end of 100 Level, *TRIPLEHAY* is a *Second Class Lower Student* with *CGPA* of *3.435*.

9/19/21, 13:24 - Dan Will: A Cigarette smoker without money can leave his house with faith that when He gets to the joint his friends will buy for him and for sure even without begging, his friends will say guy take one stick. That's Love.

A guy who loves beer without money can leave his house to a beer parlour with faith that his gang members will buy for him and for sure even without asking, his friends will say guy take one bottle. That's love.

But can a hungry/jobless person leave his house to a religious organisation with faith that someone will give him money to come and eat???

Where is the love that we preach everyday? 

Have you bothered to ask a member of your church/Mosque (religious organisations) how life is treating them? 

People go through a lot and only few will voice out.

Someone will sow 1million naira seed in a religious gathering but beg him for 1k out side he will say no money.

This is why it's easy for the devil to confuse young minds to join bad gang because they even show love more than most people that preach love.

We the religious people really have to step up and start practicing this love that we preach🗣🗣

Think about this and Act accordingly

      Of course,in a council of followers, u would have the bad sheeps,this as even been B4 d foundation of men creation.
      My point is that some people have d capacity but do nothing to help one another and later tell God they have bless is house(mosque or church🤷).

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Brother Clifford made it a duty upon himself that come sunshine or rain, he will be at the Train Station distributing Gospel Tracts to passengers as they board or leave the train! This he did faithfully for several years!
One day at the church service after a rendition by the choir members in church, the choir was appreciated, praised and given a standing ovation. Brother Clifford, instead of being happy for them was very sad. He thought his soul winning efforts was not being acknowledged, rewarded and recognised by the church members and ministers.
He also noticed that nobody from the station has met him to say thank you for what he has been faithfully doing over the years.
Brother Cliffird decided to abandon the trips to the Train Station. Instead he joined the choir and started singing with them. To his surprise he was warmly welcomed. He discovered also that very soon he was singing and receiving standing ovations. He concluded in his mind he has just made the right decision.
One day, he sang Psalm 23 as a solo and by the time he finished singing, the whole church including the pastoral team and the elders were on their feet clapping and giving him a standing ovation.
Suddenly there arose an old man, a stranger in the midst of the congregation who asked to sing the same song while the church was still on their feet clapping for the soloist.
Against protocol, the pastor cynically allowed the old man to sing.
By the time the old man finished singing, the whole church was on their knees, some weeping, others praying in repentance.
That day, there was no more sermon but an altar call. With sinners giving their lives and backsliders returning to their first love and the whole church rededicating its life.
Brother Clifford, the evangelist in choir robe, felt a deep hole in his heart. He felt empty. He saw the difference between entertainment for the appreciation of men and the ministration for the appreciation of heaven. He left the church with a heavy heart.
Without thinking of removing his choir robe, he headed for the Train Station empty handed as if in a trance. Getting there he met a man in the same spot where he used to stand to distribute gospel leaflets before. The man was distributing gospel tracts and handed him one. The Tract read "I WILL BE A FAITHFUL SOLDIER, I WILL DIE AT MY POST". It ended asking, "are you a faithful witness of the WORD?"
With tears in his eyes and a shaky voice, he asked the man how he came to start distributing the tracts at the spot in the Train Station. The busy man, not looking at him, told him of a dead man who used to come there come sunshine and rain to distribute tracts. That for months the man has not been there. He told him that he believed and concluded the man must be dead. He said the dead man once gave him a tract before that changed his commitment to Christ. And since the man was dead, he felt God wanted him to replace the dead man to continue the good work in the memory of the dead man.
The man kept emphasising, "The Dead Man, The Dead Man" which further sent Brother Clifford back to his knees weeping and asking for God's forgiveness.
Hmm...
If you are still reading this believe me, God has set you up to read it because He has a purpose for your life.
Have you left your assignment because of some discouragements from cynics and critics?
Have you abandoned the unheard, unseen and unsung praise of heaven for the standing ovation of men?
Are you like the evangelist in choir robe? Or are you like the singer singing to entertain in church - the place of entertainment is in the theatre not the church.
The church is for ministration in the Spirit by Worshiping God in The Spirit and The Truth.

Get the matriculation number format for your dept and use your dummy list serial number (±2) to generate yours. It's not necessary to stress yourself if you don't have anything to do on the portal for now as everything will be in order soon. Thank you!

9/25/21, 23:19 - Felix Bus Admn: But you know if you are constructing frequency distribution you usually exclude negative sign but it you are dealing with moments you put it in
The minus should be there that's why it will later results to zero

_2020/2021 ACADEMIC SESSION_

*PRESS RELEASE*

26/09/2021
04:15pm

*UPDATE: REGISTRATION, ADD/DROP APPLICATION AND PORTAL ACCESSIBILITY FOR FRESH STUDENTS*

The deadline for payment and registration now lingers till 11:59pm today while application for 'add and drop' form will commence thereafter.

In another development, it has been brought to our notice that fresh students (both 100L and DE) could not access their respective portals due to 'invalid login parameters'.

All fresh students should note that they would no longer be able to login with their JAMB registration number as their matric numbers have been generated.

Furthermore, the matric numbers will soon be available to them through their various departments and that will eventually serve as their new login parameters.

*As he removed his handkerchief while he was going, his (N15,000) dropped and he didn't notice.*

*QUESTION OF THE DAY*

10/1/21, 11:30 - Keji CM Uil: I think you will explain then use the formular for standard deviation you gave to solve the nxt question
10/1/21, 11:30 - +234 708 425 8910: Sorry, I don't understand.
10/1/21, 11:31 - Keji CM Uil: U will explain the method of calculating standard deviation for group and ungroup i guess
The you give the formular for calculating both
10/1/21, 11:32 - Keji CM Uil: Then you will choose the formular suuitable for calculating the next question which is ungroup to solve it
10/1/21, 11:32 - Keji CM Uil: Sorry i dont really know how to explain
10/1/21, 11:33 - +234 708 425 8910: Alright. Thank you
10/1/21, 11:35 - +234 708 425 8910: You said grouped and ungrouped. 

The question mentioned individual series which I think is for ungrouped(please correct me if I'm wrong)

Doesn't that mean we're to explain all the moments under the individual series and then....God! I'm even more confused 🤦‍♀️
10/1/21, 11:37 - Keji CM Uil: Yes ma 
Sorry Buh i thought the question is telling us to explain both individual and discrete
10/1/21, 11:38 - Keji CM Uil: After explaining then you use it to solve the nxt question ma
10/1/21, 11:39 - +234 708 425 8910: Thanks so much

10/3/21, 10:48 - +234 808 198 9500: Where is the world going?
 1-Adultery is allowed in South Africa.  No man or woman has the right to repudiate the other because of adultery anymore 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
 2-The United States confirmed that all the countries of the world, to establish good relations with the great powers, must accept same-sex marriage (woman / woman or man / man).  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
 3- Germany has just signed the law which declares that there is no more incest, that is to say: brother and sister can get married, mom and son, dad and daughter, etc.  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
 4-The city of Miami is now proclaimed the city of purchasing public sex.  This means: on the way, to church,
 at the mosque, at the market, at the soccer field, if you need sex you can enjoy it anytime without any problem.
 5-Canada has authorized bestiality (sex with animals) 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
 6- In Spain: pornographic films
 are allowed in high school and universities.  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
 7- Authorization for the prostitution of minors is given.  Marg Luker states that any young girl at the age of 10 who experiences sexual pleasure,
 no one should defend her from
 find out how her body works.
 8- Finally, the USA made it possible to open satanic churches publicly.
 Dear brothers and sisters, the end is near, the departure into Glory is approaching.
 Christians are being distracted and the devil wants to draw with him as many souls as possible in order to withdraw them from divine mercy.  Let's be careful.  😭😭😭😭😭😭

 If you have a minute ... share this post.  Why do we sleep in church, and stay awake in bars?  Why is it so hard to talk about God but so easy to gossip?
 Why is it so easy to ignore messages from God but send back dirty messages?
 Are you going to send this message to your friends or are you going to ignore it?  If you love God, send this message to your true best friends in 60 sec.  🙏🙏🙏🙏
     God bless you.  Amen!!!

10/4/21, 14:50 - +234 706 235 4433: I want you all to be mindful of your security. Listen to news regularly
The country is going through very difficult and unsafe times. Presently there are calls from foreign concerns to declare Nigeria a failed state. This is because of the level of insecurity in the country presently. 

We all need to be concerned about our safety. Do not say it can never happen to me. No one is safe. Relatives of the President had been kidnapped. Men of God, Security men etc. No one is safe, nowhere is safe. Let us try and observe strict security protocols together with our prayers.

*ONE*
Never to stay out of the house late.
Come back home latest 6pm.
Do not attend church programs beyond 6pm except it's a vigil. Whatever they're doing if they don't close by 6pm, please I advise you to leave and start going back to your house.

*TWO*
Do not travel in marked vehicles. For example, vehicles bearing names like CAC, New Covenant Church, University, JAMB, WAEC, company etc. 

*THREE*
Do not travel in groups. If you are to go for a program, move alone.

*FOUR*
If your area is being attacked, switch of all lights including any switch with lights no matter how tiny. Remove all jewelry on your body and wrap your phone in a cloth to prevent light reflection that can betray your position. 
If you hear gunshot, leave your bed and lie flat under the bed and out of your window. Get out of sight. Lie close to any wall.

*FIVE*
Do not take ride in any vehicle that you don't know. Take public transportation at all times.

*SIX*
When you go out, dress normal and neat not flashy. Never wear any clothes that can get you noticed or identified. 

*SEVEN*
If you are going out to somewhere, tell someone where you are going to and the expected time of your arrival. If possible don't go alone.

*EIGHT*
On no account should you visit online friends. People who you meet on social media, you should never visit them either in public or in their home or office. NEVER.

*NINE*
Speak very little when you are in the public and never comment on government or political issues.

*TEN*
Always maintain call credit on your phone and always ensure you have power on it or buy power bank. You may need to make contact incase of ATTACK. 

*ELEVEN*
If under attack, do not make voice calls, because sound travel faster and quietly at night, just ring the number repeatedly if the person pick, don't speak. Just send text. When doing that do it under cover so that your phone will not reflect any ray of light.

*TWELVE*
Don't buy group dress from anyone for now. No matter how close they are to you , don't buy. 

*THIRTEEN*
Don't attend parties that you are not closely concerned.

*FOURTEEN*
If at all, you come under attack, remember there are only 2 rules to guide you. 
*1) DO NOT PANIC*
*2) NOT TO FORGET RULE 1* 
If you panic, you will attract attention of the attackers to yourselves, and you will not remember exactly what you need to do to keep you safe.

*FIFTEEN*
This is not the time to do fashion or to showcase your new clothing and shoes or us expensive cars or cars that will expose u. Anytime you go out wear dress and especially shoes that will allow you to run incase you need to get out of troubled area fast. Wear cheap shoes that you can throw away if it impedes your movement. Your dress should not hinder your ability to run. 

*SIXTEEN*
Prepare for any eventuality. Do not say it can't happen. Be Prepared. Trouble can happen anywhere any time. Remember your life is very important , not your phone or your property. 

*SEVENTEEN*
If you have to run, throw away anything in your hand. Save yourself first. Don't wait to pick anything that drop from your hands. Run as fast as you can.

*EIGHTEEN*
If there is shooting, try the rules. Do not panic. The fact that you heard the gunshot means that you are not hit. If you are hit, you will not hear the SOUND. 
#. Reduce your height first by bending down as close to the ground as possible. 
#. Then try and identify the direction of the shots first then draw a cross putting the direction of the shot at north or south, run East or WEST. 
#. Never run straight line in opposite direction because bullets travel at straight line and never run toward the point of the gunshot. 
#. As you are moving out of the troubled area, identify hard objects or structures that you can use as protection where you can hide. 
#. If you notice the sound is coming closer, shift your location a little as you continue to run. If not, find a safe place and hide in sitting position to avoid stray bullets from hitting you. 

*NINETEEN*
At this moment, avoid arguments with People. When you notice people are showing anger, don't wait to settle them, move out of the place as quickly and quietly as you can. .Don't go to places of incidents to go and look what's happening.

*TWENTY*
At this moment, stay as close as possible to your home. Know the shortest possible routes to your home incase you need to get home quickly.
Always keep some change at hand. Not much, maybe 2k or less incase you need to board a public transport out of any trouble area.
*OPEN YOUR EYES AND BE ALERT.*
_Suspect everything including people and places._...

Please🙏🏾Adhere Strictly and stay safe. 

Peace be unto you!!!

*PRESS RELEASE*

*UPDATE: SCARCITY OF WATER ON CAMPUS*

Without mincing words, we express our great displeasure on the scarcity of water and instability of electricity supply which has been prevailing on campus even at this examination period.

Earlier today, we visited the University water treatment plant in order to access the state of things. During the visit, it was discovered that out of the two treatment plants, one is currently undergoing a general repair which will linger for about a month. However, the second treatment plant would be up and running to supply water across campus. 

Be rest assured that we will continue to work closely with the Works Department to ensure that there is a consistent supply of water.

Focused Unilorites, your perseverance and patience at this crucial time are not going to be taken for granted. We remain committed in the struggle to attain justice.

1. A big percentage of people using these apps do not even know who the founder is. They only found people enjoying the apps and the joined.



Similarly, a big percentage of the people on the earth do not know who the creator of the heavens and the earth is. They only found themselves in this world and immerse themselves in its enjoyment without asking, "Who is the creator? Why did he create me and these enjoyments?".



2. When the disruption happened, we were all helpless. Someone like me thought it was a network issue, I kept faulting MTN till past 7pm when I received a call from a relative telling me that the disruption is worldwide and it only affected Mark Zuckerberg's apps.


Yet, we couldn't control the event, because we are not in charge of the process.



This is how death would visit a relative, you'd try to reach out to him but no response and you'd think he got a flat battery or he's experiencing network difficulty in his area only to find out that he has left the world 6 hours ago.



3. WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook stopped working suddenly and I'm sure....


a. Some people would be chatting at that moment just like me.


b. Some people would be making call via one of the apps at that time.


c. Some people would be holding live session.


d. Some people would be typing comments at that moment...



And a lot more.



The shutdown happened so suddenly; you and I did not prepare for it.



So my time and your time will be up one day and the angel will take my soul and your soul suddenly giving you room for no preparation.



The question is, what will you be doing at that time?


Will your last action be an evidence for you or against you?


See, don't think too far, let me save you some mental stress; your last action is what you're doing now, as the next breathe is not guaranteed.



A quick reminder from your brother

10/8/21, 10:26 - +234 708 425 8910: Why do you think its annuity?

10/8/21, 10:29 - +234 708 425 8910: Periodical payment isn't applicable to annuity only

10/8/21, 10:31 - Nene Bus Admn: What's the payment for compound interest?

What's for compound interest?
10/8/21, 10:35 - +234 708 425 8910: I think all of them are done periodically. 
Isn't that why they give specific years as to when payment will be made/received?
10/8/21, 10:36 - Nene Bus Admn: No dear
I don't have data
I would have checked.

1. SINGULAR SUBJECT (Doer of action that is being reported).

A subject is Singular if there is only one thing, person or place.

2. PLURAL SUBJECT: (Doer of action that is Being reported).

If the doers of the action are more than one, then we have plural subject.

Now you should note that "I" acts as a Plural due to it functions in some sentences.

3. SINGULAR VERB:

Lexical Verb Is Singular if it carries "S" at the back e.g Takes, writes, knows.. all Singular. 

We have Singular primary auxiliaries: is and was only.

We have Singular anomalous verbs: has and had only

We also have modal auxiliaries: can, may ,will and the likes

Please note that modal auxiliary Verbs do not have Singular or Plural. They Only have present and past form.

A lexical verb is Plural if it does not carry "S" at the back.. e.g take, write, know.

We have Plural auxiliaries: are, were , am

We have Plural anomalous: had and have

So Let's Move to The Rules.

LET GRAMMAR WORDS AGREE 

1. When the subject is Singular, the verb working with it should be Singular too.

2. When the subject is Plural the Verb working with it should be plural also.

FRAMING A QUESTION 

Do not ever put an "S" at the back of the Verb when it is a question. 

He Goes- now this is a correct sentence 
But the moment this sentence becomes a question, then you don't add the "s"

For example

Does he go (not:goes)
Do they go (not goes)

USING WILL, CAN, MAY AND OTHERS 

Any verb that follows any modal auxiliary (whether the modal is in present or past form) should be simple present Tense without "s"

So you can't say:
She will goes❌❌❌
Instead you say she will Go

USE ‘TO’ APPROPRIATELY 

Any verb that follows to should be in present tense without "S" even if the event you are describing is past.... just put a present Tense after to

For example 
I wanted to go last year
She likes to see you
We need to know him

So You Should know There are certain times that You would see a Gerund(a noun which is an ing verb) coming after the to.

For example 

With a view to finding 
I look forward to seeing 
She is used to dancing 
She admitted to stealing 

And all sort..

SECRETS OF BEING 

The Verbs that could come before the word Being are;

Is, was, are,were, or, am, only

You should not use has/have/had before Being e.g He Has Being beaten ❌

Instead you can say he is being Beaten.

BEEN IS NOT BEING 

The only verbs that could come before been are has, have, had, e.g He has been beaten, They Have Been seen.

AVOID ERRORS WITH HAS, HAVE, HAD

You should Take Note That Has is Singular and Have is Plural while Had is the past form of Noth of Them. Any verb that follows has/have/had should be in past participants form. 

For example 
He has eaten... eaten here is a past participle.

BEING AND ITS USAGE 

The words that could come after being are past participle verbs only. E.g He is Being Beaten(not beating)

They are being addressed (not addressing)

It means at the moment you make the statement the action is going on. Do not put an adjective in front of Being 
For example 
He is being handsome 
She is being beautiful

BEEN AND ITS USAGE 

The words that could come after been are Ing Verbs or past participle verb

For example for ing verbs

They Have been beating the boys 

Example for past participle 
They have been beaten by the Teacher.

ON, IN, OF, FOR AND OTHER PREPOSITIONS AND THEIR RULES 

Any verb that follows a preposition should be in.... ing form 

For example 
By coming to school 
For dancing well 
Without telling lies 
On getting to school

So by, for, without and on are all prepositions and they are always followed by ing verbs

USING DO, DOES AND DID CORRECTLY 

Any verb that follows do/does/did/do not/did not/does not should be present Tense without "S" 

For example 
I do speak
It did cry
It does move

After do, does or did.... do not put a verb that has an "S" or a verb in the past tense but the one in the present tense only.

SOMEBODY GO OR SOMEBODY GOES 

Any verb that follows the following words should have an S at the back I.e it should be a singular verb, Singular lexical or singular anomalous or Singular Primary auxiliary

The words are;

Anybody, someone,anyone,somebody,nobody, none, no one,something,anything,nothing,somewhere,nowhere,everything,anywhere,everyone, everybody,

So any verb that follows these above words should be Singular 
For example 


Nobody knows
Everybody sees
Somebody hears

So also you should say 

Everybody is (not are)
Everybody has (not have)

Note that wherever every appears, the noun in front of it must be Singular 

E.g Every Problem (not every problems)
       Every power ( not every powers)
        Every Sunday (not Every Sundays)

BUY TWO BREADS AND THREE WATERS 

Uncountable nouns are nouns which we cannot count because they are not in single units. They include all liquids(water kerosene, petrol, oil).

Measles is bad or measles are bad

Pluralia tantums are words that appear with 's' at the back as if they were Plural nouns, but which in actual fact are singular. 

They could be categorized as follows;

1. School subjects: physics, mathematics,economics,civics,statistics, etc

2. Diseases 
Mumps, shingles and measles 

3. Games 
    Darts, snakes and ladders, bowls and draughts

Each Officer or Each Officers

Each should have a Singular noun in front of it

For example 
Each + Boy... The next verb should also be in Singular 

Each + girl + knows (not know).

Beware of Each of

Each of should have a Plural noun and a Singular verb

Each of + plural noun + Singular verb

For example 

Each of the boys laughs 
Each of the Students is Ready (not are ready)

Each of the girls has a skirt (not have)

Information Go round or Goes round?

Information is part of the Uncountable nouns, For all uncountable nouns a singular verb should follow 

For example 

Information makes(not make) the world go round 

Water is (not are) important to the health 

The news has (not have) been broadcast

Beware of one of

One of should be treated as each of. They obey same rule 

For example 
One of my brothers looks Handsome 

Note that Plural noun + singular verb

Some of

Some of should have a Plural noun in front of it and a plural verb.

Some of + plural noun + plural verb

Some of + the teachers + know me (not knows)

Some of the Students are brilliant 

But note that when you have some of with Uncountable noun use a Singular verb

Some of + Uncountable noun + Singular verb

For example 

Some of the water spills on the floor

One thing You Should Note About English Language is That it's dynamic, things would changed over time.

What used to be correct during the time of wole soyinka would not be correct in some time to come from now.

AGE CLASSIFICATION

Senior or Junior does not apply to age

These are my senior sisters ❌❌❌

But
These are my elder sisters✅✅✅

Older is the word to use when comparing two people's Advancement in age.
For example

We are classmates but I'm certainly older than you.
Elder, the difference between older and elder is that older attracts than whereas elder does not.

He is elder than me ❌
He is older than me✅

Note that to discuss position of authority, e.g in office, we choose Junior(officer) senior (office)

Happening once in a while

There are many ways of stating what happens occasionally, in other words such a thing happens,  Attimes not atimes

The manager and me / The manager and I

Note that 
Subject + me = us
Subject + I = we

So you have 
The Teacher Called Akpan and me = The Teacher Called Us

Akpan and I were called by the Teacher = We were called by the Teacher

Unconsciously leaving something behind

Only things that are abstract can be forgotten or that we can forget.  You cannot forget something that you can see with your eyes 

For example 

I forgot my phone (physical thing) ❌

I left my phone ✅

I forgot your name (abstract thing)✅

You may also have I forgot to take my... That's Correct ✅

Sometime/sometimes

These two are different in that, sometime attracts ago while sometimes does not. Sometimes means not all the time; occasionally while sometime ago means time in the past

Note that sometime cannot stand without ago

Defamation of character 

When someone says untrue things about another person in public that is called slander. But if they go ahead to write such things down and made available for public consumption, it is libel.

Both are forms of defamation of character.

Loan And Rent 

To borrow is to get something for your use from someone else with the intention of returning it while lend is to give something out to someone for their use, with the intention of taking it back. To rent is to take possession of something for one's use for some time.  The difference between borrow and rent is that, whereas one does not pay money for borrowing something one pays some amount of money as rent.

LOOSE
Loose is addictive which means not tight 

Loose is also a verb which means to make free from tying

Loosen is a verb which means to make not very tight

Lose is a verb which means not to be on contact with something or someone anymore 

Lost is the past form of lose

Loosed is the past form of the verb loose 

Loss is the act or value of being parted with something

For example 
He lost his parents. The loss is very great because he has no one else to support him through school

At Hand

At hand means that which is seen or available,  offhead does not exist in English language. Offhand means spontaneously, easily said from the head without racking your brain.

SEEK FOR ADMISSION ❌

Seek is a verb which does not take the for preposition. In fact it doesn't take any preposition: I am seeking for Admission ❌❌

I am seeking admission ✅✅✅

More Grease to your elbow❌❌

The idiomatic way of encouraging someone on an activity is to say:

More power to your elbow✅ not more Grease to your elbow.❌

REQUEST

Do not use the preposition for with request

I hereby wish to request for your support ❌

I hereby wish to request your support ✅

COMPRISE

Do not use the preposition of with COMPRISE

The family comprises of four boys ❌

The family comprises four boys✅

11/4/21, 21:12 - Phillip Bus Admn: *RESUMPTION UPDATE*🔥🔥

As *lecture commences for the rain semester on Monday, 8th November,* the academic unit wishes every member of GSF a successful semester.

👉As we all await our results, we would also like you to know the following:

1. *This 2nd semester is just for 10 weeks, rather than the usual 4 months😲.* Therefore be informed the semester will be extremely short. 

2. *Exam will commence on the 24th of January, 2022 (+ or - 1 week)* , all things being equal. Therefore we urge everyone🤲 to collect materials from their seniors and start reading as soon as possible. 

3. *Test will commence either on the 2nd week of December or on the 1st week of January*. That's only 4 weeks - 6 weeks time. We urge everyone, especially those offering CBT, to pay good attention to this and resume as early as possible. 

4. *Lastly, exam for the semester will end on 2nd week of February* . Before you know it we're in February!.. Therefore, we encourage you all to endure till the end as it remains only a short time😵‍💫. Don't let too much rest destroy the success story you've started. Very soon, all will be over and rest will come😃.

We wish everyone a good and outstanding result in the just concluded exams in Jesus name. Make sure you back up those exams with prayer.

11/8/21, 06:15 - +234 909 109 3693: Yo! Good morning.🤓

Happy Resumption Distinguished Unilorite.🥳🥳🥳

As you start another phase of your Academic pursuit today, May Almighty God help and guide you through. May he provide for you, your parents/guardians/sponsors. Amin!🤲

Also, I wish you success and best of luck in your just concluded first semester T-Examination. May the result come out in flying colours and favour you. Amin.🙏

Do well to resume early and attend classes once your Timetable has been released and your classes have started. Do not play with any class, either virtual or physical as it's very important and would help you to understand the Lecturer's view more on the course.😁

Again, do not forget that this Semester will be extremely short, for that reason do not use any of your time to play too much. I wish you a hitch-free Semester.😤

Yours Truly;
*TRI🅿️LEH🅰️Y*

11/10/21, 16:31 - Ridwan Bus Admn: Good day lovely minds, this is to solicit for financial assistance for a student of University of ilorin who is a 400level student of our Faculty. This student is really going through alot and is in dire need of financial assistance as he has been going through a whole lot for the past 15weeks due to the fact that his mother has been terribly sick and he is the only son, and they have spent over 700,000naira on the sickness, although, the mother is now recovering and responding to treatment but this individual borrowed some funds online and the organizations are threatening to post his pictures online and tarnish his image as a fraudster and criminal who is wanted, let's help save his name and image, he only have few months to graduate.

The individual is helpless and plead for financial assistance as he doesn't know anyone to run to for support.

This is the first time this student will ever seek for any financial assistance and this student seriously need the sum of *#200,000* as the loan amount is increasing everyday due to daily overdue charges. Your #1,000, #1,500 #2,000 will go a long way in helping.

11/11/21, 09:46 - +234 810 074 9690: I pity the 100L students who have decided to enjoy the break that does not worth it. Don't forget your 1st Semester result is not released yet, and your fate is unknown to you at the moment.

You have 2nd semester to push up your 1st semester to get you the chance of crossing to the next level...

Unilorin will release results deep into 2nd semester activities, and by then you will be left with no choice than to struggle to catch up.

Out of the 10 weeks for this semester, you have sacrificed 1 week to the altar of break.

Think twice and resume back to campus as soon as possible.

I'm only being concerned because you are my friend and brother. The best is all I want for those that are dear to me, and i won't be happy seeing you shedding tears of 'had I know'

11/13/21, 11:46 - +234 818 717 9708: An unemployed professional woke up one morning and checked his pocket. All he had left was 100.00mt He decided to use them to buy food and wait for the time to die, since he was too proud to beg.

He was so frustrated that he couldn't find a job and he had no one available to help him.

He bought his food and while he sat down to eat, an elder and two small children approached him and asked for food, since they had not eaten in almost a week.

The professional stopped looking at them.
they were so thin that their bones were visible and their eyes had sunk into their faces. With the last bit of compassion he had left, he gave them his only food.

The elder and the children prayed that God would give him blessings and prosperity, and gave him a very old coin in thanksgiving.
the young professional told them:
"You need this prayer more than I do."

Without money, jobs and food, the young man went under a bridge to rest and wait for death.

He was about to fall asleep when he saw an old newspaper on the floor. He picked it up and suddenly read an ad that told those with old coins to take them to a certain address.

He decided to go to that place with the old coin. When he arrived at the address, he gave the coin to evaluate the merchant. the merchant shouted and took out a large book and showed the young man a photo.

It was the same coin, whose value was 3 million dollars.
The young man was very touched while the merchant gave him a $ 3 million bank note. he collected the money and went to get the elder with the children.

When he got to where he left them to eat, they were gone. He asked the owner of a nearby canteen if they knew them. The owner said no, but they had left him a message. he quickly opened the letter thinking that they would leave how to find them.

This was what the message said:
«You gave us everything you had and we rewarded you with the same coin.
As: God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit ».

Prayer:
This is your financial blessing!
It is a simple prayer, it has 30 seconds. If you need a financial blessing, keep reading this message.

Glorious Father, generous and loving God, I pray that you will abundantly bless my Family and Me. I believe You know that a Family is more than just a father, mother, brothers, husband and wife, but that we are all Family and we believe in You. Father, I raise this prayer asking for a financial blessing not only for the person who sent this to me, but for Me and everyone who broadcast this message around and that the power of our united prayers will work for those who believe and trust You. 🙏🙏🙏

11/15/21, 22:42 - +234 808 198 9500: A woman was taken 
by 5 men, 
who according to   
hospital and police report was raped by a 
gang before 
being dumped at a 
bus
station!

Though she was unable 
to remember 
the events of the previous evening, 
tests conducted 
revealed that she had 
been raped repeatedly.

There was a 
trace of 
*Rohypnol* in her blood.

*Rohypnol*, 
is presently being 
used as a rape drug.

It is actually
 a small sterilization 
pill which is now being 
used by 
rapists to drug their 
targets at 
parties.

The drug makes the 
mind of the
target (would be victim)
go blank 
so that she does not remember 
anything that transpired and worse still, 
the drug sterilizes the victim so that 
she doesn't conceive 
from the rape 
and the rapist need not worry about 
having his identity 
revealed 
later by a paternity 
test.

The real bad news is 
that the drug's 
side effects 

ARE NOT TEMPORARY, 

they are
PERMANENT.

Any female that 
takes it 

WILL NEVER BE ABLE 
TO CONCEIVE.

The drug is
administered by 
dropping it into the 
target's drink.

The girl wouldn't 
remember a thing the 
next morning, 
nothing at all that had 
taken place the 
night before 
will she remember.

Rohypnol, dissolves 
rapidly and 
easily in drinks, leaving 
no taste and 
no change in color 
which makes it 
impossible to detect.

These weasels can 
get this drug 
from anyone who is in 
the vet school or 
any medical  university.

It's that easy and 
Rohypnol is about to 
break out big 
on campuses everywhere.

Believe it or not, 
there are 
even sites on the 
internet telling 
people 
how to use it.

Girls, 
please be careful when you're out, 
especially in a party, 
don't leave your 
drink unattended.

(Buy your own drinks, ensure bottles 
or cans received are unopened or sealed; 
don't even taste 
someone else's drink).

For guys - 
Please inform all your female family members, relatives and friends. 

Remember you also 
have sisters or 
might one day have 
a daughter(s).

Important News are 
meant to be 
passed on, 
please don't keep or 
ignore.

Please share to 
protect and save lives.

🚫PLEASE Share If you really care for your daughter/ sister / mother / wife / girlfriend ❤ 🙏

It's a new scam, the paper is laced with drugs, U'll pass out so they can kidnap, rob or do worse things to u. Pls forward to all friends n family..Save a life please. This was received from police intelligent unit this morning. Take note and alert everyone u want to protect. This is not a joke please. Pass on to family and friends. Sent as received. Thank you!
11/20/21, 12:41 - +234 818 717 9708: PLEASE BEFORE YOU CALL UBER/BOLT TAXI FOR SOMEONE ELSE, PLEASE KINDLY READ THIS REPORT

This is shocking....... "Someone was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death because a man he didn't know in a bar pretended that his phone battery had gone off so he requested him if he had the uber app to request a cab for him so that he could go home.

Remember uber/bolt has the details of the phone owner so whenever you request, it's recorded. So the following morning the uber driver was found dead and the car missing.
The uber company produced to the police the phone details of the last person that had requested the service and that's how he got implicated and then sent to Prison, awaiting for his death date.

1. Please don't request a cab for anyone, not even your friends. They could be jealous of you and set you up. You will have to go through an expensive process of proving that you only requested the uber for them.

2. Remember to treat everyone as a suspect when they make such requests.

Please forward to alert your loved ones and save them.

11/25/21, 14:38 - Kabirat Bus Admn: Okay
11/25/21, 14:38 - Kabirat Bus Admn: Thanks
11/25/21, 14:56 - +234 915 340 7265: I don't think 200# is too much for anyone here right! 

We have fees to pay. The registration for the tournament is 5000#, imagine 15 people bought the form which is not even certain, that makes it #3000 where's the remaining #2000 coming from?  Nobody cares but that's not a problem. 

If you you guys feel like you can't take this seriously, it's better we call it off and know only 100L won't be participating in the tournament. 

This shoudnt be a big Deal, I'm surprised you guys are turning a deaf ear and reluctant to represent your own level.
11/25/21, 14:56 - +234 915 340 7265: The tournament starts 4 days from now. And the team is still no where to be found.

_2020/2021 ACADEMIC SESSION_

*PRESS RELEASE*

*UNFORTUNATE CAR ACCIDENT ON CAMPUS*

We express our sympathy about the car accident that happened after the school dam. The unfortunate incident was alleged to have happened as a result of overspeeding of a private car which in turn hit a korope shuttle bus.

The disastrous occurrence which happened around 9pm yesterday evening claimed some lives (with the drivers of both vehicles inclusive). We deeply commiserate with the families of the deceased persons and pray that God grant them the fortitude to bear the irreparable losses.

Also, we wish the injured victims quick recovery as they receive treatment at the hospital. 

Students should however note that academic activities are suspended for today.

We hereby enjoin the members of the University community to remain calm.

*I don't think we should just tell her take care of yourself, while y'all hearing what's going on with her in the hospital, and besides with the VN I'm listening to she isn't sounding like one who's getting better*

*I think the best idea is to put any of her relatives to call maybe they should come over to Ilorin to discharge her and take her to a better hospital where she would be given Enough attention.... Y'all know that health comes first in humans life then others like education or another thing can come after that*

*Travelling to help a Life ain't too much, if y'all understand what I'm saying*

*Be safe and get well soon*@2349010511939 .

12/18/21, 16:59 - +234 902 544 5475: *HOW TO CALCULATE CGPA (UNILORIN)*

©️ *TRI🅿️LEH🅰️Y*

*IMPORTANT KEY POINTS:*
📍 *GPA* means Grade Point Average and it can be got at the end of each semester.
📍 *CGPA* means Cumulative Grade Point Average; it's up-to-date mean of *GPA* and it can be got at the end of atleast 2 Semesters.

📍The grades are as follow:
A, B, C, D, E and F. 

✍️ Each grade is equivalent to a certain number of point. 
📍A - 5
📍 B - 4
📍C - 3
📍D - 2
📍 E - 1
📍 F - 0

The score for each grade:
📌 A: 70-100
📌 B: 60-69
📌 C: 50-59
📌 D: 45-49
📌 E: 40-44
📌 F: 0-39

Example: The following are the courses taken by *TRIPLEHAY* in his 100 Level first semester with Credit Units and the grades got after exams included:

*FIRST SEMESTER:*
      *COURSE*  *UNIT*  *GRADE*
📍GEM 101      3         A
📍CVE 103      2         A
📍ENG 107      2         B
📍MAC 101      3         C
📍HIS 103       2         D
📍EDU 107      2         E
📍PLB 103       1         F
📍GNS 111        2        A
📍ECN 103      3        B
*TOTAL UNIT (TU):* 20

For more enquiry and latest updates: https://wa.me/2349038634254?text=I+want+to+be+viewing+your+status,+my+name+is

*GRADE POINT PER COURSE:* is got by multiplying equivalent points of each grade got per course by its Credit Units.

Thus,
- GEM 101 (3×5) = 15
- CVE 103 (2×5) = 10
- ENG 107 (2×4) = 8
- MAC 101 (3×3) = 9
- HIS 103 (2×2) = 4
- EDU 107 (2×1) = 2
- PLB 103 (1×0) = 0
- GNS 111 (2×5) = 10
- ECN 103 (3×4) = 12

*TOTAL GRADE POINT (TGP):* 70

 *GPA* : TGP/TU
 *GPA* : 70/20
 *GPA* : 3.5

Total *GPA* of *TRIPLEHAY* at the end of 1st semester is *3.5* 

This is the end of how to calculate your *GPA* after first Semester result.

The other steps below show how to calculate your *CGPA* beyond a Semester.

Let's assume he able to accumulate a *Total Grade Point* of *80*  for his second semester courses with total credit unit of *20*. His second semester *GPA* will be *80/20* which results in *4.0*

*TRIPLEHAY's* CGPA at the end of 100 Level having Completed two Semesters can be got in two ways:

1. By adding the *GPA* for both semesters together and divide by 2. This is illustrated below:

- 3.5+4.0/2
- 7.5/2
- *3.75*

2. By adding the *Total Grade Point* for both semesters together and divide it by the addition of all credit units for both semesters together. This is illustrated below:

- 70+80/20+20
- 150/40
- *3.75*

*CLASS OF DEGREE & EQUIVALENT CGPA:*
- First Class (4.50-5.00)
- Second Class Upper (3.50-4.49)
- Second Class Lower (2.40-3.49)
- Third Class (1.50-2.39)
- Pass (1.0-1.49)

As at the end of 100 Level, *TRIPLEHAY* is a *Second Class Upper Student* with *CGPA* of *3.75*.

Are you feeling stuck in any situation? 

Hold the line, it won't last forever. It may take time but everything has an end to it. All you need do is to keep your head up high, keep praying keep working and believing. Embrace every season, for with every season comes a new beginning. You're the genius the world is waiting for.

NOT FOR EVERYONE!!

"Give N50,000 to a secondary school dropout and watch him buy a stove, a frying pan, cooking oil and other things to start Indomie business.

In just three years, the young man will have a wife, a plot of land worth N1million, a Tokunbo car, a TV, sofa, bed, etc in his one-bedroom house.

Give N1m to most university graduates and watch how 70% of them will buys  Apple Iphones, Samsung Galaxy phones and several pairs of skinny jeans, take their numerous girlfriends out, take selfies and post them on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

In less than two years, they will be buying Indomie on credit from the secondary school dropout and paying rent or staying in their parents' house.

The question is:
DOES EDUCATION BREED WASTE, ARROGANCE, GULLIBILITY AND STUPIDITY?

Education does not necessarily breed any of the above, but it makes you look down on possibilities as "not befitting my status".

Unemployment is actually higher amongst the educated than amongst the uneducated.

The uneducated are more innovative and ready to do what the educated will refer to as "dirty, menial jobs".

And before you know it, the uneducated guy will be needing an Accountant to manage his finance books and will now employ the educated guy!

That is the reality of our society!

1/25/22, 10:18 - Ridwan Bus Admn: *DECLARATION Of INTENTION*
Great Nuambssites !!
   
Jim Rhon said _"A good objective of leadership is to help those who are doing poorly to do well and to help those who are doing well to do even better_."
Distinguished Students of the great department of  Business Administration, It is with great joy that  I Oseni Quareebat Tinuola popularly known as " *Tinuola* ", a 200L student of  Business administration declare my intention to serve our great department in the capacity of the *Vice President* for the 2021/ 2022 academic session.
 
I am a  young lady who is deliberate about contributing positively to those around me and ensuring to be a safe place for everyone without being judgemental.

Though a growing young lady, I have been able to achieve a lot ever since I became a bonified student of our great department.


I graduated from Initiative For Sound Education, Relationship And Health Associate Ambassadors(ISERH) Undergraduate Studies class 5, a non governmental organisation on  campus that helps to promote  quality health, sound relationships and proper education among young people. 

I was also privileged to attend Emerging women in politics cohort 1 where I learnt a lot about leadership and also carried out a project to fix Ila-oja community school alongside other amazing women.

Dear NUAMBS, there is so much we can achieve if we work and also grow together. 
   I humbly request to be granted the privilege to serve our great department.
Thank you.
    *Tinuola*

1/26/22, 11:08 - +234 808 198 9500: JUST ANOTHER COMMON SENSE LECTURE.
NOT FOR EVERYONE!!

"Give N50,000 to a secondary school dropout and watch him buy a stove, a frying pan, cooking oil and other things to start Indomie business.

In just three years, the young man will have a wife, a plot of land worth N1million, a Tokunbo car, a TV, sofa, bed, etc in his one-bedroom house.

Give N1m to most university graduates and watch how 70% of them will buys  Apple Iphones, Samsung Galaxy phones and several pairs of skinny jeans, take their numerous girlfriends out, take selfies and post them on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

In less than two years, they will be buying Indomie on credit from the secondary school dropout and paying rent or staying in their parents' house.

The question is:
DOES EDUCATION BREED WASTE, ARROGANCE, GULLIBILITY AND STUPIDITY?

Education does not necessarily breed any of the above, but it makes you look down on possibilities as "not befitting my status".

Unemployment is actually higher amongst the educated than amongst the uneducated.

The uneducated are more innovative and ready to do what the educated will refer to as "dirty, menial jobs".

And before you know it, the uneducated guy will be needing an Accountant to manage his finance books and will now employ the educated guy!

That is the reality of our society!
My counsel...let us work as if we have no certificate, remain humble"- Copied

1/27/22, 15:05 - Phillip Bus Admn: Okay, guys! 
We all do know we want someone from our side, to win that post.
So why don't we just conduct a mini poll to see who wins and then go with that for a stronger candidate. Which I think is better than losing to other department.
Can we decide on a time to do that.

 *PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT*
And now we're done with *PUNCTUATION*😉😉😉


We move to 😄😄 *PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT*
 *Introductory* : This is where background information is discussed. It contains overall plan of the way the argument in a written discourse will be developed as well as the scope of the discourse.
One after the other now !
*Structure and Purpose of Paragraphs* 

- Introductory paragraph
- Body paragraph
- Concluding paragraph
- Inductive paragraph
- Deductive paragraph
 *Inductive* :It opens with either proof or reasons culminating in the author`s assertion at the end of a paragraph. It is also referred to as ‘conclusion oriented’. *Deductive* : It starts with the author`s assertion, while the remaining sentences in the paragraph are used as proofs to support the assertion.
 *Concluding* : It contains the summary of the argument in the discourse.
*Body* : It centers on a single subject in line with the focus of the discourse. Sometimes, an idea may flow from one paragraph to another one. The first body paragraph follows the Introductory and others follows each other. *Characteristics of a Paragraph* 

- Unity
- Coherence
- Completeness
- Emphasis
 ```Both topic sentence and supporting sentences develop into a paragraph or paragraphs through various techniques.```
 *Components of a Paragraph* 

A paragraph starts on a new line and the central idea of a paragraph is summed up in the sentence called the *topic sentence* .

The other sentences which expand the topic are called  *supporting sentences* .

The topic sentence could be the first sentence in a paragraph as an *introduction* .
The topic sentence could be the last sentence in a paragraph as *conclusion*

It may also come in the middle of a paragraph I hope you get 😉
 *Techniques /Methods of Paragraph Development*

They are: definition, explanation, exemplification, simplification, description, comparison and clarification.

 *Carbello (2014), identifies eight different methods* , which are: “Facts and statistics, examples and illustration, process, comparison	and contrast, cause and effect, classification and analysis, definition, and analogy”.
*Take note pls*✍️
Unity: This means, a writer of a paragraph must be concerned with one main idea or topic. A well written paragraph must have unity. That is, everything in a paragraph must be related to the main topic and must be capable of being summarized in a single sentence.
 *Coherence* : Well written paragraph must be coherent. That is, ideas in a paragraph must be arranged in a clear logical order. Transitional devices, linear structuring of times sequence or space order, contrast and comparison, may be used. Key word may be repeated. Transitional words and phrases such as: ‘consequently’, ‘meanwhile’, ‘however’, ‘furthermore’, etc. may be used.
*Unity* : This means, a writer of a paragraph must be concerned with one main idea or topic. A well written paragraph must have unity. That is, everything in a paragraph must be related to the main topic and must be capable of being summarized in a single sentence.
 *Completeness* : This means that, the central idea in a paragraph must show evidence of a reasonable development. Once the idea is not fully developed, the paragraph becomes incomplete.
 *Emphasis* : The central idea must be emphasized. The idea of a paragraph must be repeated many times including repeating or summing it up in the conclusion. Expressions such as *‘chiefly’,'of course’, ‘especially’*, *'importantly'*, *'mainly*', *'imdeed'*, *'especially'*,can be used to emphasize the main idea.
They are words or phrases like;

 *First, first of all, to begin with, but, however, yet, still, on the contrary , in contrast, nevertheless, on the other hand, though, although, even though, similarly, likewise, also, in the same manner, another, and, in addition, again, moreover, furthermore, besides, in the first place, secondly, thirdly, for instance, a case of point, now, meanwhile, while, soon, earlier, later , next, at last, finally, in fact, indeed, therefore, this, as a result of , to sum up, in short, in all etc.*
We're done with **PARAGRAPH DEVELOPMENT*

Let move to *WRITING* boss 😃

ARE WE READY?
*Traditional or Linking words and phrases* are used to join sentence or part of sentences to make them more Coherence. They also indicate the relationship between a sentence and the one before or after it .
*Creative Writing* : is a type of writing, where the writer`s imagination is solely at work. It has three broad aspects referred to as genres and they are prose, essay and poetry. The conventions is demonstrated through fiction and non-fiction. Simple narrative and complex verse are the two dominants literary devices and language styles used by creative writers to send their messages across.
Types of Writing


There are several types of Writing, which includes;

- Letter writing
- Creative writing
- Essay writing
- Report writing
- Speech writing
Etc
Remember that we have four language skills, which are;

Writing
Reading
Speaking
Listening.

We have discussed almost the four skills since last semester ☺️🤤
But you still need to reminder as it's part of the course outline.

So we start with writing.
*What are transitional markers?*
*Writing* is one of the invaluable four skills of learning in English language. The other three are Reading, Speaking, and Listening. Writing performs the function of putting in black and white visibly the operations of the other three skills.

 It's a means of communication through the use of graphic symbols to sensitize a reading audience about a contextual experience. 

In another words, it`s “the use of symbols of letters of the alphabets and their combination in order to relate to the sound we make when we speak” (Byne, 1979, pg.8).
*Writing* is the process of codifying one’s thoughts such that another person is able to share one’s experience. A writer is a reader moved to emulation.
 *An essay* is a piece of writing on a particular subject matter  . It's typically written to inform audience about a particular concept.
 *ESSAY WRITING*
 Composition is a piece of continuous writing on one topic.

 *Essay* is a kind of composition in which a writer states his knowledge or gives his opinion about a particular subject (Udofot & Ekpenyong, 2008 pg. 194).

 _Writing an essay structurally consists of composing a passage of three parts_ .
 ```Writing as an interaction is a relationship among the reader, the occasion and purpose. It creates connection between writer and reader on the basis of purpose and audience.```
 Each has its elements
 ```Writing is both an interaction and a process``` .
The process off writing involves the stages of writing, which are;

 *Pre writing* 
 *Writing* 
 *Post-writing/ Re-writing*
 ```Writing is a product means outcome of a competed process. It's an essay, a letter, a report, story, novel, poem or any other piece of writing``` .
```Writing is also a product``` .
To go through the processes, an essayist must have *power*
```Writing as a process involves the stages of writing``` .
To go the processes, there must be *power*

Now, what power
The process of writing essay involves the tripartite stages of writing but the key component of all is *editing*
Who's an essayist?
 *Organization* is the arrangement of information in a logical and readable manner. There are three elements of a good organization; unity, coherence and development.  Organizing an essay involves organizing sentences and paragraphs.
Planning is the first activity which is *brainstorming* . This is the stage where writer thinks of what to write by listing and asking relevant questions regarding an idea. The writer gathers  materials that relate to his subject of writing.
*The power of an essay writing consists of five strategies contained in the word Power as an acronym, which are;*
P - Planning
O - Organization
W - Writing
E - Editing
R - Revision
*Revision* involves revisiting the essay or piece of writing and appraising it. *Editing* ensures that all areas of grammatical errors and structural problems are addressed. CAR formula is used, that's; Creative, Accurate and Result-oriented. Good writing ensures that you 💋 kiss; Kiss It Short and Simple 😃😃.
*Writing* involves combining a sequence or series of ideas sewn together till they form a cohesive while. Writing an essay consists of composing a passage of three parts, which are; introduction, body and conclusion.
We have four language skills

Which are:

Writing ✍️
Reading 📄
Speaking 🗣️
Listening 🎧
Let's take them one after the other.
Language is a system of communication.
We shall discuss fully about creative writing later.

Also, report and essay writing will be discussed later.

Let continue with other language skills.
Listening
Reading.

Then we end today's class with *letter writing.*
*Approaches to Intensive Reading* 

 *Skimming* : is the process of searching for relevant materials based on one's area of study or a particular topic through selective reading.

 *Scanning* : it consists of reading through parts of relevant pages already indentified during skimming.

 *Speed Reading* : it has to do with flexibility of a reader's movement of his/her eyes. That is, a reader's is expected to take in several words and comprehend them in fewer eye movements..
_Types of Reading_ 

 *Intensive Reading* : is a reading deliberately done to enrich oneself academically and/or professionally. It needs serious attention to every statement.

 *Extensive Reading* : is a type of reading for enjoyment, general knowledge, information on current affairs etc.
We have two types of Reading, which are: 

 *Intensive and Extensive*
*READING SKILLS* 

Reading is a mental or vocal reproduction of printed words.

Reading either as a mental (cognitive) or vocal exercise is aimed at understanding and interpreting written or printed words, represented by symbols (mechanical task).
*We have three types of Listening* 

1- Attitudinal
2- Analytical / critical
3- Appreciative
 *Approaches to Extensive Reading* 

Preparatory activities to extensive Reading; that is reader's has to be selective from materials available for extensive reading and in this skill, skimming and scanning are needed.
*Hearing* is the mere process by which sound waves are received and relayed along the nervous system of our ear.

 *Listening* is the process of directing attention to the sound contrast and their sequences.
*LISTENING SKILL* 

Here, we look into hearing and listening itself, because there are different.
*Principle of Effective Listening Skills* 

These are  the things to do to enhance your listening Ability 

1- Don't talk when you Listen 
2- Focus on the Speaker 
3- Allow the speaker to feel free to speak
4- Avoid Distraction 
5- Try to understand the other people's point of view
6- Be patient, don't interrupt the speaker
7- Don't be irritated by the speaker habit or mannerisms; avoid personal prejudice.
8- Listen to the tone, pitch and volume for emphasized parts
9- Listen for ideas, not just words
10- Watch the speaker for non-verbal communication aspect.
*Attitudinal Listening* : is a type of listening that involves the purpose of listening. That's a listener of this kind must be able to use similar Express used by the speaker to follow the speech event. It requires a concentration on the speaker's utterances as it relates to his emotional expression.
*Analytical/Critical Listening* : involves Listening to explicitly stated point and using the point and their contents to arrive at other points in other discourse situations. This type is for listener to criticize the speaker words or ideas and give his/her own objective view on what he has heard.
Writing is enormous and task ful.

Now *who is a writer? *Appreciative Listening* : this is where the listener hires ahead to infer the mood of the speaker and see how the speaker makes his/her words have effect on his intents meaning. Listener here is expected to listen to associate ideas and other stimuli, during the Listening process and therefore can reproduce them after listening.
Now, let's start

What differenciate you (human) from animal?
Writing is mean of communication through symbols.
Active skills: speaking, writing

Passive: listening, reading.
It's language. 

Language is the system of communication.

*Letter Writing* : This is a correspondence or message between two parties. It has three types which which could be formal, informal and semi-formal and are meant to communicate. Each has its unique formats known as “conventions”.
Writing is one of the language skills . It's an active task. It's an ability that an individual could posses or acquire. 

It involves thinking before writing, it can either be process or product.

It's an exercise, usually in continuous and usually not have an end
NOW, TO THE FINAL TOPIC FOR TODAY WHICH IS *LETTER WRITING🔥*

*SUDDEN INCREASE OF TRANSPORT FARE*

As much as we are aware of the scarcity of fuel, we frown at the sudden increase in price of transport fare by Korope Drivers. The increase which was made in the early hours of today was without prior consultation and notification to the Students' Union.

Going forward, we have scheduled an emergency meeting with the leadership of Drivers' union in order to fashion a way out of this menace.

We hereby urge our colleagues to remain calm and wait for final resolution.

*PRESS RELEASE*

*ILORIN AUTO ACCIDENT: CONDOLENCE MESSAGE*

We are bereaved and sad to have received the news about the sudden death of four of our colleagues who were involved in a fatal auto accident on Sunday 20th February, 2022 along Airport road, Ilorin. The unfortunate incident involved a private vehicle and a commercial bus conveying passengers to Lagos State. The bus was reported to have caught fire after a collision between the two vehicles.

Out of the five Unilorites on board, four died leaving only one as survivor of the sardonic event. Due to the injuries sustained, he is currently receiving medical treatment at the General Hospital, Ilorin and now stable as confirmed by a delegation of the Union which visited him yesterday. 

On behalf of every Unilorites, we express our condolences to the friends, colleagues and family members of the deceased and we pray God in his infinite mercy comfort them and grant them the fortitude to bear the loss. We equally pray that God also grant the survivor a sound and healthy recovery.

Finally, we urge every Unilorites to stay safe as we pray not to have such occurrence in our midst anymore.

Copied:

VERY CRITICAL ALERT!!!

Hello beloved saints,
I'm sure you know that New international version (NIV) was published by Zondervan but is now OWNED by Harper Collins, who also publishes the Satanic Bible and The Joy of Gay Sex.

The NIV and English Standard Version (ESV)
has now removed 64,575 words from the Bible
including Jehovah, Calvary, Holy Ghost and omnipotent to name but a few...

The NIV and ESV has also now removed 45 complete verses. Most of us have the Bible on our devices and phones especially "OLIVE TREE BIBLE STUDY APP."

Try and find these scriptures in NIV and ESV
on your computer, phone or device right now if you are in doubt:

Matthew 17:21, 18:11, 23:14; 
Mark 7:16, 9:44, 9:46;
Luke 17:36, 23:17; 
John 5:4; Acts 8:37.
...you will not believe your eyes.

Refuse to be blinded by Satan, and do not act
like you just don't care. Let's not forget what the Lord Jesus said in John 10:10 (King James Version).

THE SOLUTION:
If you must use the NIV and ESV, BUY and KEEP AN EARLIER VERSION OF the
BIBLE. A Hard Copy cannot be updated. All these changes occur when they ask you to update the app. On your phone or laptop etc.

Buy and KEEP EARLIER VERSIONS AND STORE
THEM.

There is a crusade geared towards altering the Bible as we know it; NIV, ESV and many more versions are affected.

Rapture will take place any time from now. Everything hindering the rapture has been removed. Gospel has been preached almost
everywhere, all the prophecies has been
fulfilled. The devil is working very hard to
occupy Christians with the things of this world so that the day will catch them unaware. Please be prepared, there is no more time, Use the advantage of SMS, WhatsApp, BBM,
Facebook, Twitter etc to send this message to
at least 10 people. Do not ignore.

This is also a source of evangelism, souls are dying. God bless you!

Let’s Pray Hard: 6 6 6 The Mark Of The Beast
Prophesy Finally Fulfilled… 

Written By: Jonathan Annobil. 
The US supreme Court has
rule that states must allow same-sex marriage
(SODOMY) which was the same reason God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. the US Senate has also passed the Obama Health Bill
into law. The implementation has already
commence. The bill would require all Americans to be implanted with a Radio
Frequency Identification (RFID) chip in order to access medical care. The device will be implemented on the forehead or on the arm. This is to fulfill the prophesy in the Book of
Revelation 13:15-18 concerning the MARK OF
THE BEAST. 

Are you still doubting the END TIME? Do u know that the special car which
was made for Obama is known as the BEAST?
Get READY. The rapture is near! 

Revelations
13, is being played out right before us. Many are still unaware. Why is the chip being implanted exactly where the Bible says it
would be. Why on the hand and forehead. Why not anywhere else? 2. Why is it being connected to your bank account? Remember
the Bible says you wont be able to buy or sell without the mark 6 6 6. And guess what! 

The chip is connected to your financial details.
What breaks my heart the most is that many
people in the Church will not make it if Jesus comes now? Many are unaware that the ends is near. Don’t tell me that its advancement in technology or development. If any area of your life is not in sync with God’s word repent and
be converted. If you miss heaven you can never miss hell…think about it. Hell is not a pretty place, the worst part is that it is for eternity… He who has ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the church. 

Please rather than post and forward senseless messages. Send to everyone you know. Do the work of an evangelist.

PLEASE SHARE THIS MESSAGE WITH ALL YOUR CONTACTS. 

Have you ever wondered what should have happened if we treat the Holy Bible the way we treat our mobile phone? And we really can’t live without it. Only 7% percent will re-send this message. Don’t be of the 93% who will not share the
message. 

Satan said. “I wonder how humans claim to LOVE GOD and disobey Him, and
claim they hate me yet
 they obey me” Do not send later.
Share and send now.```

Hear the clarion call,
In unity we grow
Committed to the seat of our learning,
Our hearts from vanity.
Standing firm in wisdom, in knowledge and in truth,
We honour your virtues;
Unilorin, you stand in strength and pride,
Learning, winning, building, praying,
Showing the way for all who yearn;
Making a future for the ones who follow,
Rising high we must never turn.
Ilorin, Unilorin, your torch has guided us
Upwards and onwards,
Ilorin, Unilorin our Alma Mater,
We sing!

3/31/22, 13:43 - Abdulhazeem: *THE SUNNAH OF IFTAR*



 The period of iftār is marked by the setting of the sun that is witnessed by oneself or by an honest reporter and by hearing of the Adhān from a Masjid that is upon accuracy in the matter  regarding Solah time, in one's locality.

It should not only be perceived as a period of happiness due to the anticipation of relief from hunger, thirst, weakness, etc, but it should also be seen as a moment of blessing, happiness, and togetherness that should be welcomed with all forms of humility in the remembrance of Allāh, display of gratitude, seeking Istigfaar and all other forms of 'Ibaadaat(worships)
 
Therefore, from the Sunnah of the prophet of Allāh during iftār which are also enjoined upon us are that:

 1. *One hastens to break the fast.*

 Allāh says: “...then complete your fast till the nightfall.” [Baqarah:187]

Delaying iftār will extend the fast to the following day as the fast for a day is concluded at the advent of its night time which ends the day. 'Umar (radiyallāhu ‘anhu) narrated from the Prophet (salallāhu ‘alaihi wasallam) that: *“When the night approaches from here (the east), and the daylight passes away from there (the west) and the sun sets, then the fast of a person is broken.”*

It doesn't matter whether the sky is bright or not, one should stick to the Sunnah by hastening to break the fast as Sahl bin Sa’d (radiyallāhu ‘anhu) stated that Allāh’s Messenger (salallāhu ‘alaihi wasallam) said: *“My ummah will not cease to be upon my Sunnah so long as they do not delay breaking their fast until the stars appear.”* Therefore, One should not resemble the Jews who delay breaking their fast till some portion of the night.

 2. *One welcomes iftār with Dua'a* 

Don’t get overwhelmed or carried away by the varieties of food that await you upon breaking the fast. Do not hasten to break your fast unless you have asked something from your Lord, and seek for Istighfar. 

Abdullāh bin ‘Amr (radiyallāhu ‘anhumā) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (salallāhu ‘alaihi wasallam) said: *“There is for the fasting person when he breaks his fast, a supplication that is not refused.”*

And Ibn ‘Umar (radiyallāhu ‘anhumā) narrated that the Prophet (salallāhu ‘alaihi wasallam) would say when he broke his fast:

* ذَهَبَ الظَّمَأُ وَابْتَلَّتِ الْعُرُوقُ وَثَبَتَ الأَجْرُ إِنْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ* 

*“Thirst has gone, the arteries are moist, and the reward is certain if Allah wills.”*


 3. *One breaks the fast with prescribed fruits* 

It is found from the Sunnah that the Prophet would break his fast with date and then with water if he couldn't find a date. Anas Ibn Maalik narrated that *“Allah’s Messenger (salallāhu ‘alaihi wasallam) would break his fast with fresh dates before praying [Maghrib]. And if there were not any fresh dates, then with dried dates and if there were no dried dates, he would take some mouthfuls of water.”*

The best food to break the fast with from the Sunnah is the dried date which also has its medical advantages. It's packed with fiber and natural sugar and also concentrated with calories that leave one energetic after eating. The best after it is water and other seasonal fruits (like watermelon, apple, mango, etc). for their fiber contents, easy assimilation, and digestion.

5.*Do not fall into Shaytan’s trap.*

Eat moderately. You may be deceived by the pangs of hunger from the fast into taking excessive food upon your breaking of the fast. Don’t be misled by deceit of Shaytan. Since you have won over him by having a fulfilled fast for the day, he then devises another means to have you bereft of having further rewards.

Shaytan knows that you will be too tired to observe the tarawih prayer after overeating. And if you eventually do, you are likely to be robbed of humility, ease, and concentration on your Solah, due to the heaviness of what you have consumed. 

It is also advisable that one takes little food between Maghrib and 'Ishaa and take the rest after the Tarawih.

The Academic staff union of Universities ASUU has decided to call off the current industrial strike even without Federal Government's cooperation.

According to the National chairman of the Union, the Strike was initially embarked on to see the concern of the Government over the Educational state of the country. It has concluded that the Government isn't concerned.

*STUDENTS' UNION*
KADUNA NZEOGWU BUILDING
UNIVERSITY OF ILORIN
_2020/2021 ACADEMIC SESSION_

*PRESS RELEASE*

02/04/2022
11:43am

*RAMADAN MUBARAK!*

The leadership of the union felicitates with the University Muslim Community on the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan. Beyond the fast, it is a time to encourage self-discipline, self-control, love, generousity, peaceful co-existence and other teachings of the Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.).

It is however pertinent that we all inculcate and practice these teachings even after the season.

As it is also a time to seek Allah's face, we therefore implore all our Muslim brothers and sisters to remember our dear nation, Nigeria in prayers.

Ramadan Mubarak! 🌙

4/18/22, 21:05 - Justina: Please when buying a new sim card be extra careful and vigilante.
Yesterday I saw some MTN guys selling Sims, I requested for 1 Sim card, I gave him all my details including NIN, after a successful registration I notice d guy was trying to register another sim with my details again, when I ask what for again? He said the first one was not successful, I insist he must provide the first sim he register he refuse, I then take my phone snap his picture and send to one of their senior colleague in the office, and was trying to call police, the guy started begging that he's sorry.

This type of sims they register, they sell it to kidnapers which may land you in a very big trouble.

5/5/22, 07:37 - +234 817 404 5036: *Your Wife Is Not As Good As Me In Bed*

Read This And Hear What Happened.
 
He was having his evening beverage.

That's when she joined him.

"Hi there handsome, you're looking good. So fine I can eat you up" she said sitting down.

"I thought we agreed to keep away from each other? I am a married man" he told her.

" Come on. I won't bite. You can't resist me, no man can" she said.

"I am a married man" he told her.

"Fight all you want, but soon I will have you. I am way better than your wife" she told him.

"You are nothing compared to my wife" he told her off.

https://www.pridesibiya.com/2020/01/your-wife-is-not-as-good-as-me-in-bed.html

"Really? All this body. All these curves. All these sweetness. I bet your wife is not as good in bed as I am" she told him unbuttoning the top button of her blouse to reveal her cleavage, then lifting up her skirt, just a bit.

"If I was a lustful and unfaithful man, all that would move me. But I am too grown to be enticed by what you're showing off. I am a grown man, you think all that consumes my mind is sex? And for your information, my wife is actually great in bed" he told her.

"How will you know unless you do me. Try me tonight. Let's drive in your black car to a romantic hotel, I promise you a night you will never forget" she told him.

"You know what you are? You are lazy? A lazy woman" he told her, then took a sip of his beverage.

"How dare you call me lazy?! I am a high flying educated woman. Any man would give anything to have me" she said.

"Fair enough. But would you give anything to make a man?" He asked.

"What do you mean?" She questioned.

"You look at me and find me attractive. Yet you disrespect the woman behind who I am, you want me to cheat on my wife, the woman behind my attractiveness" said he.

He drank a sip and continued, "My wife is responsible for the man in me that you want today. When I had little, my wife believed in me. These suits you see me wearing, are my wife's idea. I ask for her advice on what to wear.

My success has come to pass because she prays for me and puts up with my demanding work hours. She corrects me and moulds me and that has moulded my character.

The Range Rover you see me outside driving that you fancy, I bought that with my wife. She and I invested to buy our house. I look attractive and pleasant, because she treats me well and gives me peace.

And now you want to have the man that she made out of me and dishonour her? You want to have the man that she has built for years? You are lazy?"

Silence.

"I see you turning down the single men who want you and yet you want me, a man that another woman has made? No, it doesn't work like that.

Find your own single man, believe in him, pray for him, support him, nurture him and mould him to be the attractive man you want him to be.

You women have a nurturing and helping gift. Activate your gift.

My wife has been busy building me and I will not leave her for a woman who has nothing to offer, but her sexiness.

So if you may excuse me, I need to drive home and take my wife on a date. She deserves the best" he said as he stood up and drank a last sip.

He reached in his wallet and placed 10k on the table.

"Have yourself a drink as you think about your life and how you'll stop being lazy and find a single man you can build. My generous wife and I have paid for the drink" he said.

He walked away as she looked on; her lower jaw dropping in shock, "I thought that this world was void of principled men, I just met one," the diva seasoned as she sobered up, nodding her head.

"This guy just schooled me. In 20 minutes this smart guy has taught me the most valuable lesson which I've never found in any one of the three prestigious Universities I've attended. *How to find, invest in and make my own husband I need to find my own husband" she thought to herself as the gentleman sped off in his waiting Range Rover.

They are now in LAGOS oooo! 
This happened  this Morning in Surulere, a lady called an Aboki as we all call them, a shoe maker to help fix her slippers.
She allowed him stay in their compound, while she went back inside to continue with what she was doing.
When he was fixing her slippers, he added
something under before stitching it back. Luckily for the Lady, her landlord was at the balcony watching the ABOKI without his knowledge. 

When he was through, he called her to tell her that he has finished. She came out, he told her to try it on her leg to make sure it was OK.

Her landlord shouted from upstairs 'no oh,
don't put your leg in that slippers I'm coming.

He came downstairs; forced the Aboki to put his leg in the slippers, the Aboki refused.

Then he alerted neighbours. So, they all gathered, forced him to wear the slippers.

Immediately he put his leg in the slippers, Guess what happened?? Hmmmmmmmm!!!!!

The slippers cut... He did not sew it well...

Una like gossip sha .

5/10/22, 22:23 - +234 818 717 9708: LET ALL THOSE WHO HAVE EARS TO HEAR TAKE THIS SCAM ALERT VERY SERIOUSLY!
*Public Attention!!!!!*

Your BANK Account
could be Emptied
without an Alert.

Dear All,

Please let's be
very careful.. There is a
new HIGH TECH FRAUD
in town called the SIM
SWAP FRAUD, and
hundreds of persons
are already VICTIMS.

How does it work?

1 A new fraud called
SIM SWAP has started.
Your phone network will
momentarily go blind /
zero (No Signal / Zero
Bars) and after a while
a call will come through.

2 The Person on the
other end of the call will
tell you that he is calling
from (your cell phone
company) depending on
your network and that
there is a problem in
your mobile network.

3 He will instruct you to
Please press 1 on your
phone to get the
network back.

- Please at this stage
don't Press anything,
Just cut or END the call.
If you press 1, the
network will appear
suddenly and almost
immediately go blind
again (Zero Bars) and
by that action, your
phone is #HACKED.

Within a second they
will empty your bank
account, and you won't
receive any alert.

What you will
experience.
It will appear as though
your line is without
Network, meanwhile
your SIM has been
SWAPPED.

The danger here is
that, you will not get
any alert of any
transactions, so please
those of us doing USSD
Banking and Mobile
Banking BEWARE.

Let's
be very careful.

Please, forward to your
contacts, loved ones
and friends. The fraud
is increasing day by day.

 Rejoinder Over A Write-up By Tunde Salihu Castigating ASUU Due To Strike

-Abdullahi Junaidu

 I accidentally met a write up circulating media castigating ASUU over the incessant strike asking them to manage the situation of no fund in the country and forfeit their demands as nothing is going properly in Nigeria, my rejoinder will be against only that point for now !

Let me call his attention, in Nigeria it is only poor masses are asked to manage the situation under the pretext of no fund but the top elites in govt position are always earmarking huge amount of money for their frivilous and greedy sentiment, he didn't ask senators or any member of National assembly to forfeit their allowances and sacrifice some percentage of their salary for managing the life of Nigerians.

Between these greedy & incompetent leaders and poor masses who deserve to forfeit their entitlement to manage the life of one another ? Everyday we are seeing looting everywhere and still govt is screaming of no fund, no fund for education but there is fund to loot. Govt top officials are enjoying their luxury lives with 100% amenities while that of masses are hijacked telling them to manage the situation of no fund. 
We are seeing them distributing luxury cars and buying aspiration forms of millions.

Every year there is  Budget of renovating every office in villa and National assembly, even thier furnitures and decorations, allowances for servicing their vehicles and weekly newspaper which are all frivolous & greedy expenditure considering the country situation, huge amount of money are earmarked for these, if these money could be diverted to Education sector it would be a great achievement. 
Education and these frivolous office renovation which one supposed to forfeit it's own share ?
We have to think rational please.

Yes ! Strike is not the only option to solve this issue, students should also storm Abuja and block every road in a bid to pressure the govt to act urgently, this will surely yield better fruits as it is the only language Nigerian govt understands !

We still have some blockhead writers that have absurd audacity to support govt in trying to destroy education system by advising them to eliminate ASUU...
Be rest assured, if ASUU is dissolved today, education system will not last for decade, even if it does, poor people can no longer afford it as it will be very expensive and that is what Govt want. So we have to wake up and do the necessary !

5/19/22, 21:06 - +234 806 480 3170: All right... For me, The break has really been an engaging one

From school exams, to professional exams, to extra-curriculars and all
It's all good now... We're pushing through.
5/19/22, 21:07 - +234 806 480 3170: Then... To this.
I'd love if this session can be as engaging as possible.🌚

5/19/22, 21:12 - Ridwan Bus Admn: Please continue ma @2348064803170
5/19/22, 21:13 - Felix Bus Admn: Okay sir
5/19/22, 21:13 - +234 806 480 3170: All right.

It's quite disappointing the situation at hand ( I mean the ASUU strike) and it's totally beyond what we can control.

My purpose of having this session with you guys is how you can maximize the 4-5years to be spent here. I'll be sharing a few of my personal experiences as well as tips you can learn from.

As an undergraduate, you have to understand that what "God" has called you to do on earth is more than this University Degree. The period to be spent here should be a period of Self-Discovery. I mean developing interests in what you'll love to do.
5/19/22, 21:14 - Felix Bus Admn: Okay
5/19/22, 21:16 - +234 703 060 5928: Okay
5/19/22, 21:16 - +234 705 144 7082: Hmmm, I love the last paragraph 😎
5/19/22, 21:18 - Felix Bus Admn: Giran
5/19/22, 21:19 - +234 705 144 7082: <Media omitted>
5/19/22, 21:20 - +234 806 480 3170: I'll share with you guys a few things you can do to optimize the period to be spent here.

1. Learning about yourself: The journey towards self discovery is a whole lot I must say. This enables you to direct your path towards what you love doing and the career path you might be interested in.

2. Building Capacity: The capacity I'm referring to here means your network.
The kind of people you relate with will determine your focus and what drives you. Make sure the kind of people you share your ideas with are like-minded people who are as ambitious as you are. This will go a long way in stimulating your interests towards a particular path.
5/19/22, 21:20 - Felix Bus Admn: <Media omitted>
5/19/22, 21:24 - +234 806 480 3170: 3. Joining Organisation/Groups that'll help you grow: You need to understand that the 4-5years you have to spend here will just feature in a line on your "CV". Joining valuable organisations that'll help improve your hard/soft skills is very important to your growth.

From my personal experience, I had no idea of the existence of a few organisations as an 100level student, this made me so naive and clueless about my mission in this school. I picked up interest in joining "The Investment Society" sometime last year and I can say that was why I started having clarity of what I actually wanted to do.

These organisations will expose you to what the "Industry" out there looks like and enable you to fit in when you eventually graduate.
5/19/22, 21:25 - Felix Bus Admn: Okay
5/19/22, 21:25 - +234 703 060 5928: Okay
5/19/22, 21:27 - +234 806 480 3170: 4. Improving your Soft/Hard  skills...
Before I proceed, what do you understand by Soft/Hard Skills?
Do well to share your ideas.
5/19/22, 21:27 - +234 811 759 7730: Unnecessary cruise too much for this group ooo
5/19/22, 21:27 - +234 811 759 7730: She dey talk better thing una dey do rubbish
Oga ooo
5/19/22, 21:28 - +234 806 480 3170: Anyone?
5/19/22, 21:31 - +234 806 480 3170: Okay...

Your Soft Skills are things you won't be taught in school while your Hard skills are things that relate directly to your course work.

Soft skills are basically what you know but you just need to improve on. Your Soft skills are Communication skills, Leadership training, problem solving skills, cognitive flexibility,etc

The world out there is not necessarily interested in what you graduated with, although it is very essential in giving you a good stance. But your soft skills are things that sells what you have to offer naturally. The world presently is interested in problem solvers.

Ask yourself what you have to offer and what problems can you solve at the moment?
5/19/22, 21:32 - +234 705 144 7082: Hard skills are technical knowledge or training that you have gained through any life experience, including in your career or education While Soft skills are personal habits and traits that shape how you work, on your own and with others
5/19/22, 21:32 - +234 705 144 7082: Imo
5/19/22, 21:32 - +234 806 480 3170: Exactly...
Thank you for your contribution @2347051447082
5/19/22, 21:36 - +234 806 480 3170: For your hard skills, 

I must emphasize on this, that as a Business/Management student. There are a few things you have to know that you won't be taught in school. 

For you to be thrive in this field, you must be proficient in the use of Basic Microsoft office tools.

Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, etc

Your course work ( BUS 108 and BUS 212), might not cover these.

It's very sad that till date, a few graduate still go out there in search of jobs without having basic knowledge of these tools.💔
5/19/22, 21:36 - +234 806 480 3170: Maximize this break, by learning basic tools that'll help improve your hard skills.
5/19/22, 21:38 - +234 806 480 3170: No one told me what Microsoft Excel is used for when I came to Unilorin, No one!

I'm sharing these tips with you guys so as have an exposure of a few things which you need to know!
5/19/22, 21:38 - +234 705 144 7082: Thank you very much 😊
5/19/22, 21:38 - +234 703 060 5928: We are with you sis
5/19/22, 21:42 - +234 806 480 3170: Moving on...

I know a few of you might be engaged with learning one thing or the other or probably working.

If you can join a NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATION this period, please do.

Volunteering experiences gives you an advantage of what else you can add to your CV.

Support good courses in your society!
Bring up an initiative!
Partner with NGOs
Tell them how humane you have and what you have to offer!
5/19/22, 21:42 - Justina: @2348064803170 thank you so much ma
5/19/22, 21:45 - +234 806 480 3170: 4. Internship Opportunities: This is an exposure a few people do not take advantage of, probably because our Department do not make it compulsory.

But I can tell you having a prior experience gives you an advantage. Before graduating, you probably have an insight of what work processes seem like.

Use this break to apply for opportunities, Go to firms close by and tell them you want to intern with them. You might be lucky enough to get one, just try!
5/19/22, 21:48 - +234 806 480 3170: If you have the money, visit online learning platforms and take courses related to your coursework.

There are a lotttt of platform you can even learn for free!!!

Visit Coursera, Udemy, LinkedIn learning, etc

Just make sure you're making valuable use of your time!
5/19/22, 21:48 - +234 908 441 3748: Yan Yan
5/19/22, 21:50 - Keji CM Uil: What kind of firm can we intern with sorry🥲🤲
5/19/22, 21:53 - +234 806 480 3170: I'll leave you with a few words...

Do not leave this University without making sure you've made an impact...
Do not leave this University with an empty CV!
The "BSc" Degree is just a line on your CV
Take a few responsibilities!
Volunteer for projects!
Lead Initiatives!
Take Professional exams, if you can multitask!
Campaign for NGOs
Partake in sports!
Just make sure you make an impact.

Your CV is what sells you to your potential employer... If you graduate with an empty CV, it shows you lack the ability to multitask or probably you do not know how to handle projects.
5/19/22, 21:55 - +234 806 480 3170: Thank you for your question.

Your interests(career path)determines the kind of firm you might want to intern with.

You can intern with Consulting firms, Advisory firms, etc
5/19/22, 21:57 - +234 806 480 3170: Just note that, as an Undergraduate... You're too young to specialise.
Be flexible, open to learning about new career opportunities.
As time goes on, you can decide to choose from the options available to you.
5/19/22, 21:58 - Keji CM Uil: Okay.📌
5/19/22, 21:58 - +234 806 480 3170: I hope y'all make use of the few tips I've shared.

You can do well to ask questions if you have any.

If you're shy, my DM is open.😊
5/19/22, 22:00 - +234 806 480 3170: Thank you for sparing your time.
Have a good night rest.😊
5/19/22, 22:00 - +234 703 060 5928: Thanks ma
5/19/22, 22:08 - +234 811 759 7730: Thank you ma

6/6/22, 21:35 - Felix Bus Admn: *SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT* 

This a message from the Lord.

The Lord said that *FULANI warriors have planned to invade Yoruba land* and cause a massive bloodshed to an extent that some people will prefer to jump into rivers than being butchered  like cows.

The Lord said we should announce to everyone in Yoruba land that every family should build an *altar of prayer and pray with Psalm 20*  everyday in their homes for *God to deliver us from Fulani warfare and destroy them.* 

The Lord said he wants to deliver us but we haven't called on him to do so

 *Please pass it on to contact and groups on your your phone.*
*De king 👑 Felix cares ✌💕💖*
